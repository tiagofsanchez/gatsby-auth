  Gatsby auth example
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new my-hello-world-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-hello-world-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Following through gatsby user authentication tutorial

I started with the [gatsby authentication tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/), with hardcoded values. 

Feel free to follow through

## Implementation with AuthO 

After that I used started to think about using Auth0 as this was super easy as per their tutorial that you can follow through [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react) for the basics. 

However, because here we are implementing it with gatsby, probably it would be better to go through [securing gatsby with auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/securing-gatsby-with-auth0/).
